Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Divide the dough in half. Roll out one half of the dough into a large rectangle (about 30cm x 40cm / 12in x 16in). Spread the melted chocolate filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                      |

Place the roll on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                      |

Once the roll is out of the oven, immediately dip it into the melted chocolate, coating completely. Place on a wire rack to set.  Brush with the vegetable oil glaze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                      |
